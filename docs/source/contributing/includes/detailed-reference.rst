Detailed Reference
--------------------

Contributions to the project can be made using the "Fork & Pull" model. The typical steps are:

1. Setup your development environment by forking the repository and installing dependencies (see :ref:`Development Environment`).

2. Implement your changes. Use the Ruff linter to ensure your code conforms to the accepted style. (see :ref:`Linting`).

3. Implement the appropriate tests (see :ref:`Testing`).

4. Commit changes ``git commit -a -m "my message"`` (see :ref:`Commit Messages`).

5. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your GitHub fork (see `GitHub PR instructions`_).

Otherwise, if you encounter any bugs or have an idea for a new feature but don't have the time to implement it, please open an issue on the `GitHub Issues`_.
