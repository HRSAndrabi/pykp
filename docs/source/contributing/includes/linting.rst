Linting
^^^^^^^^

The project uses `ruff`_ for linting code. The linter is configured to enforce the `Google style`_ guide for Python code.

To lint the code, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

	ruff check

This command will check the code for any style violations and provide suggestions for fixing them. You should ensure that your code passes the linter before submitting a Pull Request.
