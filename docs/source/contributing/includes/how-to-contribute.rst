How to Contribute
-----------------

Contributions to the project can be made using the "Fork & Pull" model. The typical steps are:

#. Create an account on `GitHub`_.
#. Fork `PyKP`_.
#. Make a local clone: git clone https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/pykp.git.
#. Make changes on the local copy. 
#. Test (see below) and commit changes ``git commit -a -m "my message"``.
#. Push to your GitHub account: ``git push origin``.
#. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your GitHub fork (go to your fork's webpage and click on "Pull Request." You can then add a message to describe your proposal).

Otherwise, if you encounter any bugs or have an idea for a new feature but don't have the time to implement it, please open an issue on the `GitHub Issues`_.
