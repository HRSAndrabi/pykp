	Miscellaneous information about PyKP (py·kay·pee).

I created this package as part of a research project involving the knapsack problem.
Throught this project, I learned a lot about the knapsack problem, and the pitfalls of writing code to solve combinatorial optimisation problems.
I hope this package will help others avoid the same mistakes, and be useful in their own learning and research.

You can learn about me and my other projects my `personal website`_.
