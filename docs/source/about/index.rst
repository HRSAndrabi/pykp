	Miscellaneous information about PyKP (py·kay·pee).

I created this package as part of a research project, in attempt to better understand the 0-1 Knapsack Problem.
While writing the package, I learned a lot about efficient optimisation.
I hope this package will help others learn from my mistakes, and be useful in their own learning and research.
